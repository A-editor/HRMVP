# Tabs Manager

Tabs Manager is a browser extension for Chrome meant to be most useful when a user has multiple tabs open from a few different websites. The idea being that, in the course of researching a bug for example, you may have six or seven tabs open from stackoverflow.com, and a similar amount each from medium.com, youtube.com, etc. These tabs quickly become difficult to work with and separate out as the tabs shrink on screen. 

Tabs Manager will organize the tabs be website (alphabetically) and then categorize and display all tabs that are open in the extension window.

You are also able to navigate to each tab from the extension window by clicking a button next to the tab information.

## Features 

Upon opening Tabs Manager (Ctrl + A), all tabs will be sorted by their website, in alphabetical order.

Tabs will be displayed in the extension window under their respective URL.

You can navigate to a tab by clicking on the appropriate button with the tab title.


## Future Plans

There is a secondary window in the extension which will display the contents of a webpage regardless of whether you are on the page or not. Currently, this is done by pressing "Show Code" next to the tab whose webpage you want to display. This is intended for cases where you may wish to read/copy code from stackoverflow or similar websites without having to navigate away from your current tab. At the moment this feature is working but only displays the plain html/js code without css.
